                        Creating an account and logging in is really easy. You can either click the links on the home page which will take you to the corresponding page, or you could use the links on the navbar at the top. The navbar links can be found under profile as shown in the picture below. When a user is logged in, the user's username is shown on the top right instead of 'profile'.                    </p>

                        Creating a survey is a very simple process in Surffee. To create one, the user must be first logged in to their account. when that is done the user can navigate to the top right side of the navigation bar and press on create survey as shown in the picture attached.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Then the user is asked to provide a name for the survey and a description. Both fields are required for creation. The list present in the survey creation page is for any necessary Personal Information question which we can create automatically for you in each survey. The user is free to choose any number of them or none at all. It is important to note that these questions do not appear in the survey details but will be shown at the start of the survey as intended.

                        When a survey is created it is automatically marked as inactive and must be made active in the survey details page. This will be explained in another section of this documentation. All surveys can be found under their current category's drop-down list (active/inactive) on the sidebar or from 'My surveys' on the top right side of the navigation bar. The later will display all surveys under their category in a separate page for clarity. The pictures below show each of the corresponding links.

The screenshot below illustrated the different actions regarding the survey. On the top center there is a toggle button that changes survey from active to inactive and viceversa. The delete button on the right deletes the whole survey completely. The card includes the Personal info selectded during the survey creation and the section on its right displays the description specified during creation. A sample question is also visible below.

The initial symbolises the type of question during question creation, for instance single or multiple choice. The picture below shows another example for a single choice question. Single choice means that only one answer is acceptable, therefore in the example below an answer to the question can be either True or False, but not both. The opposite holds for multiple choice questions where more than one answer is acceptable. At the right corner of each question there is an options button, that when clicked shows a drop down list with edit or delete options for the current question. Before we go into those two options and their corresponding page, it is important to explain the rest of teh question panel.

                        The choices for each question are listed below the title. A blue badge is shown below each choice indicating the number of votes of each of those choices from respondent answers. On the right of each choice there is an 'x' button that removes the current choice from a question along with all of its votes.
