Because of our association of the taste of vegetables with our ridiculous nicotine addiction, we now find sugar and junk food less appetizing. Nestle crumbles. We begin to genetically engineer the vegetables to naturally produce their own nicotine. We all think more sharply from all the phytonutrients in our blood. we overthrow capitalism. We all have nationally excellent gut health. We end all wars. We realize we've had the tools to automate virtually every job known to man for years, and we can power the robots with the sun and wind infinitely for the rest of time. We end labor, and begin a new phase of human existence where the main goal of a society isn't acquisition of wealth, but of experiences, knowledge and understanding of self. We explore space and alternate dimensions in search of new, tastier vegetables to put in our salad. We unlock the secrets of the universe while also fiending immensely for our next hit of broccoli.
