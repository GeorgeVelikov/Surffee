                        Welcome to Surffee, the Intelligent Survey System. This documentation serves as a guide to the applications features. Below you will find all features listed in sections. The side bar on your right serves as a table of contents with links to all sections. Clicking on of the sections will take you to it.                    </p>

                        Creating an account and logging in is really easy. You can either click the links on the home page which will take you to the corresponding page, or you could use the links on the navbar at the top. The navbar links can be found under profile as shown in the picture below. When a user is logged in, the user's username is shown on the top right instead of 'profile'.                    </p>

                        Creating a survey is a very simple process in Surffee. To create one, the user must be first logged in to their account. when that is done the user can navigate to the top right side of the navigation bar and press on create survey as shown in the picture attached.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Then the user is asked to provide a name for the survey and a description. Both fields are required for creation. The list present in the survey creation page is for any necessary Personal Information question which we can create automatically for you in each survey. The user is free to choose any number of them or none at all. It is important to note that these questions do not appear in the survey details but will be shown at the start of the survey as intended.

                        When a survey is created it is automatically marked as inactive and must be made active in the survey details page. This will be explained in another section of this documentation. All surveys can be found under their current category's drop-down list (active/inactive) on the sidebar or from 'My surveys' on the top right side of the navigation bar. The later will display all surveys under their category in a separate page for clarity. The pictures below show each of the corresponding links.

The screenshot below illustrated the different actions regarding the survey. On the top center there is a toggle button that changes survey from active to inactive and viceversa. The delete button on the right deletes the whole survey completely. The card includes the Personal info selectded during the survey creation and the section on its right displays the description specified during creation. A sample question is also visible below.

                        idea: we spray all the vegetables with nicotine. everyone gets addicted to salad. people on their break start chaining apples instead of cigarettes. everyone's BMs are amazing and frequent. Everyone's skin clears up. We all get in great shape. Everyone starts jogging just for fun. We all fiend so hard for vegetables that sustainable agricultural practices thrive. Because of our association of the taste of vegetables with our ridiculous nicotine addiction, we now find sugar and junk food less appetizing. Nestle crumbles. We begin to genetically engineer the vegetables to naturally produce their own nicotine. We all think more sharply from all the phytonutrients in our blood. we overthrow capitalism. We all have nationally excellent gut health. We end all wars. We realize we've had the tools to automate virtually every job known to man for years, and we can power the robots with the sun and wind infinitely for the rest of time. We end labor, and begin a new phase of human existence where the main goal of a society isn't acquisition of wealth, but of experiences, knowledge and understanding of self. We explore space and alternate dimensions in search of new, tastier vegetables to put in our salad. We unlock the secrets of the universe while also fiending immensely for our next hit of broccoli.
